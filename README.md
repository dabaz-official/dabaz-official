Hi, Iâ€™m Diebold Dai (DabAZ), an entrepreneur passionate about turning visions into thriving realities. As a 6-figure business owner striving to reach the 7-figure milestone, Iâ€™ve learned that perseverance and a clear vision are the cornerstones of sustainable success.

With a foundation in information security, Iâ€™ve built my career across diverse fields, including technology, design, and music, eventually channeling these experiences into entrepreneurship. My journey has been shaped by a commitment to continuous learning and the ability to adapt to ever-changing challenges.

Currently, I lead a [trading company](https://cobotrading.com), focusing on providing high-quality products to the North American market. My mission is to create impactful businesses that not only achieve financial success but also deliver value to customers and partners worldwide.

Beyond business, Iâ€™m a hacker, musician, designer, and developer, blending creativity and technical expertise into every project I pursue. Whether itâ€™s crafting seamless user experiences or composing music, I believe in the power of interdisciplinary thinking to inspire innovation.

Let's [connect](mailto:hi@dabaz.me) and explore how we can build a better future together.
